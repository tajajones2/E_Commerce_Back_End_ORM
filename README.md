## Usage

- GIVEN a functional Express.js API
- When you add your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then you am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
- When you enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
- When you enter the command to invoke the application, then your server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
- When you open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then you am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in your database.


// TODO: complete usage tags, product & categories //
